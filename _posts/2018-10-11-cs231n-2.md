이 포스팅은 딥러닝에 대한 기본 지식을 상세히 전달하기보다는 
간략한 핵심과 실제 모델 개발에 유용한 팁을 위주로 정리하였습니다.



## Detection and Segmentation

1) semantic segmentation : 
- sliding window
- Fully convolutional : labeling class per every pixel
  - downsampling and upsampling : how to upsampling(unpooling)
      - nearest neighbor 
      - bed of nails 
      - max unpooling(remember which element was max)
      - Transpose Convolution

2) classification + localization :
- class score : softmax loss
- box coordiantes(x, y, w, h) : L2 loss
	- treat localization as a regression problem

- aside : Human pose estimation

3) Object Detection
- fixed set of categories and draw box location
- benchmark dataset : PASCAL VOC
- each image needs a different number of outputs - not easy to solve with regression
- sliding window : crops of the image, CNN classifies each crop as object or background 
	- how to choose crop? need to apply CNN to huge number of locations and scales very expensive
- region proposals : selective search gives 1000 region proposal -> brute force but high recall
- R-CNN 
	- region of interest(RoI) from a proposal method (~2k)
	- Warped image regions
	- forward each region through convNet
	- classify regions with SVMs
	- Box regression
	> slow train and inference
- fast R-CNN
	- Forward whole image through ConvNet
	- RoIs from proposal method on convnet feature map of image
	- RoI pooling layer
	- fully connected
	- classification and regression
- faster R-CNN
	- make CNN do proposals
	- insert *region proposal network(RPN)* to predict proposals from features
	- jointly train with 4 lossess

- detection without proposals : YOLO / SSD

4) Instance Segmentation
- Mask R-CNN - similar to faster R-CNN
	- can also does pose : add joint coordinates
- bechmark data : microsoft coco data


## Visualizing and Understanding

> what's going on inside ConvNets?
> What are the intermediate features looking for?

- visualize the filters : raw weights
	- not that interesting

- Last Layer : 
	- check Nearest Neighbors in faeture space(last fc layer)
	- dimensionality reduction : PCA, t-SNE
